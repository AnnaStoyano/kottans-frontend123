## Git and Github
I've just finished the course Version Control with Git on Udacity.com and read some of extra marerials. I've learned a lot of useful and very cool informations. In my opinion Git is very powerful.
- As for me there are a lot of thing that was new to me: branching, tagging, merging and undoing changes. Now I know a lot of git command that are very useful. Just look on **git log** command. It displays everything! At the same time I've learned the structure of Version Control System(working directory,staging index and repo). 
- I was surprised by some command such as git diff(display differences that doesn't be committed), git log and its flags(this command display everything!) and,of course, branching(it's so useful and helpful).
- In future I intend to use branching(especially **git checkout -b** and **git merge** commands, git commit,of course :), and git log with flags.
