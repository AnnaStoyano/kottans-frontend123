## Git and Github
I've just finished the course Version Control with Git on Udacity.com and read some of extra marerials. I've learned a lot of useful and very cool informations. In my opinion Git is very powerful.
- As for me there are a lot of thing that was new to me: branching, tagging, merging and undoing changes. Now I know a lot of git command that are very useful. Just look on **git log** command. It displays everything! At the same time I've learned the structure of Version Control System(working directory,staging index and repo). 
- I was surprised by some command such as git diff(display differences that doesn't be committed), git log and its flags(this command display everything!) and,of course, branching(it's so useful and helpful).
- In future I intend to use branching(especially **git checkout -b** and **git merge** commands, git commit,of course :), and git log with flags.
## Linux Command Line and HTTP Tools

- I recognized a lot of new information about HTTP and learned many commands. In my opinion such learned commands as ```find, cat, grep and echo``` are very useful. Also I learned the principle of work HTTP.
- I was surprised by ```|``` operator because it help combine 2 actions in just 1 command!
- I intend to use such commands: ```ls, mkdir, pwd, chmod, grep, etc```.

I finished **Git for Team Collaboration** and now I know many git commands for keeping in touch with the remote repo (```git pull, git push, git rebase```) and what are mean ```Fork and Star``` buttons. All of this are very useful.
- Now I know this command ```git pull, git push, git rebase```. There are fantastic! Also I learned functionality of Fork and Star buttons.
- I am better understand ```pull request``` and Fork repo after having completed this course. I was surprised because I hadn't known that ```git pull``` combines at the same time 2 commands ```git fetch and git merge```.
- All of this I intend to use in future especially  commands ```git pull, git push``` and sometimes ```git rebase```.
